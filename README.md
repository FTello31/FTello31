## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I’m Fernando Tello, a **Cross Platform Developer** (specializing in **Front End Web Development**) pursuing my Bachelors in **Computer Science & Engineering**.

👨‍💻 I enjoy contributing to **Open Source Projects** and am really enthusiastic about learning new technology. In 2020, I learnt **Django**, **Electron**, **Flutter**, **React** and **TypeScript**. In 2021 till now, I learnt **Next.js**, **SASS**, **Progressive Web App (PWA)** and a bit about **Three.js**. I also got started with [**freelancing**](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01c12e516ee1d35044) and [**blogging**](https://dev.to/ruppysuppy) recently.

🎸 Outside the world of tech too, I love pushing myself to develop new skills ranging from **guitar**, **break dancing**, **sketching**, **touch typing** to some whacky ones like **writing with my left hand** (only aiming from mastery only in **guitar** and **dancing** though).

📚 I love reading books on **personal development** & **financial literacy**. My favourites ones are **The Compound Effect**
by _Darren Hardy_ in the genre of personal development and **Rich Dad Poor Dad** by _Robert Kiyosaki_ in the genre of financial literacy.

✈️ I love **travelling** as well, even though its been some time since I last travelled. My last trip was a solo trip to **Bhutan** in _2018_.
